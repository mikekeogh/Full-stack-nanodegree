Intro to Relational Database
Final project: Swiss tournament

Overview:

The project consists of a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament. The module is unit tested by other Python code that exercies the calls that implement the tournament.

What is included:

There are 3 files associated with the project.

tournament/
|-- tournament.py             # main module for database and tournament functionality
|-- tournament_test.py        # Unit test code to verify tournament.py implementation
|-- tournament.sql            # Database table and view creation SQL code

Dependencies:

This implementation depends on a PostgreSQL database and the Bleach Python library.

To run:

To build and access the database, run psql followed by \i tournament.sql
In the tournament directory, use Python to run the tournament_test.py module.

If successful, the output will look like this -

1. Old matches can be deleted.
2. Player records can be deleted.
3. After deleting, countPlayers() returns zero.
4. After registering a player, countPlayers() returns 1.
5. Players can be registered and deleted.
6. Newly registered players appear in the standings with no matches.
7. After a match, players have updated standings.
8. After one match, players with one win are paired.
Success!  All tests pass!
