Movie Trailer Website

Overview:

This project contains Python modules that define classes, create content, build and show a web page that contains favorite movies.

Each movie poster image on the page will show the movie preview when selected. A movie info button will show a dialog with the movie title, release date, and a short summary of the movie.
